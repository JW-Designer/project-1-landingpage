The URL of my landing page: jytwang.com
The URL of your GitHub repository: https://github.com/JW-Designer/project-1-landingpage.git
Q: What is something you've learned while working on the landing page: 
I've gained more practice on flexbox. I've considered using grid for the 
project gallery, but in this case flexbox is more simple and responsive.
I've also tested out various gif sizes and how those can affect the loading 
speed of webpage. Gifs are compatible across (almosy) all browsers and
though smaller gifs is too pixelated when streched to the full width
of desktop, larger gif seem to be loading fine across devices.
Q: Was there anything you were unable to do on your landing page that you would have liked to do? 
I would like to add some simple javascript to my website, and some css 
transition effects.
